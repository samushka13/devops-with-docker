FROM node:20
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci
CMD ["npm", "run", "ui:build"]

What I did:
1. I copied a version of the Bloglist app from the Full Stack Open course.
2. I created the Dockerfile based on package.json scripts (no README was available).
3. I created a web service on Render with language set to 'Docker'.
